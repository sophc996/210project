# Project Overview

See "210 Final Project Writeup" PDF for full writeup, including outputs and code explanations.

This program can be run with cargo run. The graphs created by Plotters will output to two PNGs: 'all-time-rates' and 'goal-averages,' which are already attached here in Github. They will automatically update if the code is changed and run.

I changed my project idea from my initial proposal because I found that my initial dataset and approach was too computationally costly: I originally had a dataset of 498k rows that computed connections between hockey players across different leagues based on who else they had played with who acted as a bridge between two players, using breadth-first-search to find degrees of separation. However, it ended up being too large and paring it down made some connections impossible. I also struggled to handle duplicate player names and diacritics/accents in my String encoding, so I ended up going back to the dataset from my original search: a record of every Premier League match from 1992-93, when the league was started, to the 2022-23 season.

My initial goal for this project was to use preliminary data analysis to find out if COVID seasons in the Premier League had any effect on home advantage. The effect of home crowd support on match results in the Premier League is well-documented â€“  and considering that during the COVID seasons (part of 2019-20 and the entirety of 2020-21) matches took place behind closed doors, I was curious to see if that affected the home vs away win-rates of teams in the PL. I used the plotters crate to visualize several aspects of my data.
